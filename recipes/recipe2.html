    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Invented by ex-President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox.</p>
    <p>"Best Drink in Existence."</p>
    <p>Its effects are like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit</li>
        <li>One measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V</li>
        <li>Three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin</li>
        <li>Four litres of Fallian marsh gas</li>
        <li>Measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract</li>
        <li>Tooth of an Algolian Suntiger</li>
        <li>Zamphuor</li>
        <li>An olive</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
        <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those
            Santraginean fish!</li>
        <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is
            lost).</li>
        <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have
            died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
        <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redlient of all the heady
            odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
        <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep
            into the heart of the drink.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
        <li>Add an olive.</li>
        <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
    </ol>
